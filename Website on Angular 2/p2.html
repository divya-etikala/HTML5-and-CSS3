		<h2>Features of Angular2</h2>
		<p>Components : The earlier version of Angular had a focus of Controllers but now has changed the focus to having components over controllers.
                                                   Components help to build the applications into many modules. This helps in better maintaining the application over a period of time.</p>
		<p>Services : Services are a set of code that can be shared by different components of an application. 
                                                For example if you had a data component that picked data from a database, you could have it as a shared service that could be used across multiple applications. </p>
		<p>Directive: A directive is a custom HTML element that is used to extend the power of HTML.</p>
		<p>Angular 2 is a modular framework where every piece of functionality is encapsulated within a module and exposed to other parts of the application as a service . </p>
