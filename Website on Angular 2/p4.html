	<h1> Angular CLI</h1> 
  	<article>
		<p>Command Line Interface (CLI) can be used to create our Angular JS application. 
		       It also helps in creating a unit and end-to-end tests for the application
 	                   </p>

		<img src="angular-cli.jpg" alt="Angular - CLI image">

		<P>ng new : The Angular CLI makes it easy to create an application that already works, right out of the box. 
		It already follows our best practices!
		</p>

		<p>ng generate : Generate components, routes, services and pipes with a simple command.
		 The CLI will also create simple test shells for all of these.
		</p>

		<p>ng serve : Easily test your app locally while developing.
		</p>

		<p>Test, Lint, Format : Run your unittests or your end-to-end tests with the breeze of a command. 
		Execute the official Angular linter and run clang format.
		</p>

		<p>Webpack is an open-source JavaScript module bundler. Webpack takes modules with dependencies and 
		    generates static assets representing those modules. It takes the dependencies and generates a dependency graph allowing 
		   web developers to use a modular approach for their web application development purposes. The bundler can be used from the 
		  command line, or can be configured using a config file which is named webpack.config.js
		</p>

		<p>Angular CLI is a Command Line Interface (CLI) to automate your development workflow. It allows you to:
                                             create a new Angular application, run a development server with LiveReload support to preview your application during development,
		  add features to your existing Angular application, run your application’s unit tests,
 		  run your application’s end-to-end (E2E) tests, build your application for deployment to production.
		</p>
	
		<p>It is recommended to use Angular CLI for creating angular apps as you don't need to spend time installing and configuring all the required
    		   dependencies and wiring everything together.
		</p>

		<p>Angular CLI is a great tool to create and work with Angular Applications . It takes away all the pain staking work one has to do otherwise manually 
		     by making all the configuration files required for bootstrapping an angular application.
