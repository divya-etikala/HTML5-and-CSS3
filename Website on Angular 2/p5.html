		<p>TypeScript is a free and open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft.
		      It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, and adds optional static typing to the language.
 	                   </p>

		<P>TypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript applications for client-side or server-side (Node.js) execution.
		</p>

		<p>TypeScript is designed for development of large applications and compiles to JavaScript.As TypeScript is a 
		      superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs.
		</p>

		<p>TypeScript is a strict superset of ECMAScript 2015, which is itself a superset of ECMAScript 5, commonly referred to as JavaScript.
 		   As such, a JavaScript program is also a valid TypeScript program, and a TypeScript program can seamlessly consume JavaScript. 
		By default the compiler targets ECMAScript 5, the current prevailing standard, but is also able to generate constructs used in ECMAScript 3 or 2015.
		</p>

		<p>The TypeScript compiler is itself written in TypeScript and compiled to JavaScript.

		<h2> Summary On Angular 2</h2>
		<p>It is my opinion that it provides a very powerful framework for front end applications. 
		    Dependency injection let’s you use patterns that have been common place in most backend frameworks like Spring. 
		   You can separate your services/business logic away from your components and views.
		   And components makes it a lot simpler to write large scale front end apps while retaining maintainability.
                                             And from a designer perspective the only thing that changes is the initial load times for the Angular 2 application files, libraries etc. 
                                             Everything else remains the same, you can use html and css to deliver anything you want, just as you would in a normal web site.
		  As a user, after the application has loaded, we will get very quick load times. 
		</p>

		<p> If you ask what Angular 2 features set it apart from other frameworks, first on my list would be this separate module for template rendering and zones:
		      Having the component’s UI declared in separate templates processed by an independent renderer opens up new opportunities in areas from optimization
		     and precompilation of templates, to the ability to create templates for rendering on different devices.
                                                The module zone.js monitors the changes in the application and makes decisions on when to update the UI of each component. Any async event triggers 
		     the revalidation of the UI in each component and it works amazingly fast.
