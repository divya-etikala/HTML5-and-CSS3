			<h1> About Angular 2  in few words</h1>
			<div class  = "wd">
			<p> Angular 2 is not just another framework. Its Component-based web development is pretty much the future of web development. 
                                                                        If you’re unfamiliar with the component development pattern, it basically emphasizes the separation of concerns throughout a given system (Wikipedia). 
                                                                        For all the benefits of using Angular 1.x, it requires the entire stack to be written using Angular. Web components, on the other hand emphasizes the separation 
                                                                       of concerns and allows segmentation within an app to be written independently of each other. If you’re familiar with the module-loading mechanism in Angular 1.x, 
                                                                      this should come as no surprise. Angular 2 takes this a step further and requires nothing else to be written using Angular.</p>

			<p> Angular 1.x was not built with mobile support in mind, where Angular 2 is mobile oriented.
                                                                        Angular 2 is  using Hierarchical Dependency Injection system which is major performance booster.
                                                                       It implements unidirectional tree based change detection which again increases performance.
                                                                      Angular 2 provides more choice for languages. You can use any of the languages from ES5, ES6, TypeScript or Dart to write Angular 2 code.
                                                                      Where, Angular 1.x has ES5, ES6, and Dart. Using of TypeScript is a great step as TypeScript is an awesome way to write JavaScript. </p>

	                                      <h2>  Advantages of Angular 2 </h2>
			<div>
			<p> TypeScript: Angular recommends TypeScript as a primary language for writing angular app code which is a superset of 
                                                                        JavaScript and provides amazing features like auto-completion, static types, etc. <br>
                                                                      Components: The concepts of controllers has been merged inside the component functionality and hence, the
                                                                      new angular follows a tight component based architecture where components are everything <br>
                                                                     Angular Routers: Angular routers have been optimized and gives a good performance for navigation in the modern web browser.</p>

		              <h2>My  Opinion  On Angular 2</h2>
			<div class  = "wd">
                                                                <p> It is my opinion that it provides a very powerful framework for front end applications. 
			       Dependency injection let’s you use patterns that have been common place in most backend frameworks like Spring. 
			      You can separate your services/business logic away from your components and views.
			     And components makes it a lot simpler to write large scale front end apps while retaining maintainability.
                                                                   And from a designer perspective the only thing that changes is the initial load times for the Angular 2 application files, libraries etc. 
                                                                   Everything else remains the same, you can use html and css to deliver anything you want, just as you would in a normal web site.
			  As a user, after the application has loaded, we will get very quick load times. </p>
